What should be done
You need to control the interface of a simple video player in QML.

The main top part of the interface is the player screen itself.
At the bottom there are track controls, namely: the beginning of the transition button (Play), the audio pause button (Pause), the output stop button (Stop), rewind (Rewind), fast continuation (Forward).
Next behind them is a horizontal slider for the current location.

Tips and tricks
You can use Unicode characters to display controls: ▶️,⏸️,⏹,⏪️,⏩️.
You can implement the output slider using the ProgressBar element.
